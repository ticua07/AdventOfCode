# Day 7
Couldn't get up from bed in all day, probably depression
Had to get some help again from [chris biscardi's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zVAz2iMViE&ab_channel=chrisbiscardi)

- Part 1 was really straightforward and have lately been discovering some useful method from the crate itertools
- For part 2 I didn't have really any idea of what I was doing, but sometimes not understanding is Ok, remember that Advent of Code is *supposed to be fun* not **stressing**!
