# Day 8
Again, no help needed, it was an even day so the curse didn't happen.

Initially, I wrote a bruteforce of the part 2 solution (which *in theory did work*), but it would pretty much take forever (solution is **14 digits long!**), so I got help for the GCM and LCM functions from chatgpt.

Also got partially the solution from the [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/18df7px/2023_day_8_solutions/) saying to use LCM in their solutions.
